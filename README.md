# audio-sync-attempt

I tried to synconize audio between multiple devices for a rhyme synced game I'm working on. 

This will not work well on computers and/or phones with trash audio drivers.

Uses the same math as the Network Time Protocol (NTP).

The delay is noticeable but should be less than 100ms. I tried to make it shorter but it didn't work out. It isn't the best but I think the maximum of a 0.1 second delay is good enough. 

I originally wanted to make the delay less than 10ms (or 5ms) because ✨physics✨ but I couldn't figure out how to do that.
